In a blink, we'll be shopping for the holidays. That's should add up to a lot of shopping - but we'll see how secure consumers are feeling about their finances. Shopping patterns offer great insight into the state of consumers, who are the backbone of the U.S. economy (accounting for two-thirds of GDP). It's still a little early for some of the bigger industry groups to put out their holiday estimates, but we do have some data points to consider. Overall, the National Retail Federation expects retail sales to increase 2.5%-3.5% for the entire year. Stastista expects a 4% increase in holiday sales for 2024 compared to 2023. eMarketer forecasts a healthy 4.8% rise in holiday sales compared to last year. Salesforce predicts a 2% increase in 2024 holiday sales, which is still growing but at a slower pace than the 3% logged last year. In sum, consumer spending growth could be between 2%-5% this holiday period. Meanwhile, Forbes notes the following particulars about this upcoming holiday season: 1) it is shortened, with only 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas; 2) past presidential election years have shown a dip in spending leading up to and following the election; and 3) Walmart and Amazon account for roughly 38% of total retail growth, presenting a challenge for other retailers. The following is a list of BUY-rated stocks in Argus' Universe of Coverage. These represent companies that are leaders in the retail industry. Some of these stocks are also in various Argus portfolios.\"},{\"id\":\"2710_Analyst Report_1722620474000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Amazon.com Inc.\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2024-08-02T17:41:14Z\",\"summary\":\"Amazon.com is the leading U.S. e-commerce retailer and among the top e-commerce sites globally.

The Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.3% for July from 4.1% the month before. Nonfarm Payrolls printed at 114,000, much lower than the expected and the month before. These weak labor numbers raise questions: Did the Fed wait too long before pivoting to easing monetary policy? Will they enact a larger cut in September, perhaps 50 bps instead of the expected 25 bps? Is the desired soft landing still possible?

The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Nasdaq gave back almost 2%, the Nasdaq 100 declined 2.2%, and the S&P 100 dropped 1.6%. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 (IWM) surged 3.6%, the S&P MidCap 400 popped 2.5%, and the Invesco S&P 500 equal weight (RSP) gained 1.2%. NYSE breadth was quite strong at +2,200, NYSE advancing issues/total issues hit 78%, and NYSE advancing volume/total volume popped to 84%. Yes, you read that correctly. Talk about a day of rotation!   Real Estate (XLRE) was up 2.7% and Utilities surged 1.8%, both helped by falling interest rates. Materials rose 1.4%, Industrials rose 1.3%, Energy gained 1%, Financials rose another 0.8%, and Healthcare was up 0.7%. Information Technology dropped 2.5%, with semiconductors down 3%-4%.   As mentioned, momentum was scorching on Wednesday, with the S&P 500's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) hitting 82 on Wednesday, the most overbought reading since December 19, 2023. That was followed by a nasty one-day wonder to the downside and some chop for a couple of weeks before the index took off again. The 14-week RSI reached 77 this week, the highest since 79 was hit in late March -- just before a slide of several hundred points in the index that, of course, was followed by all-time highs.   The 14-day RSI for the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) hit 80 Wednesday after reaching 82 in mid-June. The 14-week RSI is in the mid-70s. Generally, we see some indigestion when we cycle this far into overbought territory. Then there is often another run higher.

The simple and trusty 5/13 exponential moving average (EMA) crossover has caught most of these moves and missed some of the downside in April. Daily momentum (14-day relative strength index) has cycled into an extreme overbought condition, but that same condition didn't stop the rally back in December. It is a warning to pay attention for divergences and/or price breakdowns, but not a reason to sell.  On the weekly chart, the SPX has run up to a longer-term trendline off the peaks since late 2022. Most trendlines are not perfect and don't hit every price point, so we certainly could draw the line a bit differently, trying to construct a regression line that best fits the peaks or troughs. We have a developing and bearish weekly moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD), this as the latest weekly closing high price has not been confirmed by a new momentum high and offers yet another warning.   The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has broken above the upper trendline drawn off the peaks since July 2023 and has demonstrated very strong momentum. We have seen periods of outperformance versus the \\\"500\\\" -- and even when the QQQ has taken a break, it has not really underperformed the SPX. However, the QQQ is quite extended versus the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. Buts these overbought conditions can last for many months and, again, are more a warning about an overheated market than a reason to sell.

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \\\"compatible with a net-zero economy\\\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \\\"sustainable\\\" business practices across all industries that can have an \\\"impact\\\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus Research, we track ESG developments at specific companies as part of our Management analysis - one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point Fundamental Approach. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from the companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, the JUST Capital Foundation, and leverage its analysis and insights on the topic as well. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on these criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \\\"sustainable impact\\\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We also have a Theme Model Portfolio based in part on the ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list.

The S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) gave back another 1.3%, and the Dow Industrials lost 1%. In the last seven days, the NYSE has dropped over 3%. In nine days, the SML is off 3.4% and the MDY is down 4%, while the DJIA has given back 4% over seven days. All four indices have broken through their 50-day averages for the first time since early/mid-April and all have given short-term sell signals by way of bearish five-day/13-day exponential moving average crossovers.   Sector damage has been broad from the recent highs, with Real Estate declining over 5%, Energy dropping 4.5%, Financials and Industrials off almost 4%, Healthcare down 3.4%, Staples and the high-flying Utilities losing 3%, and Materials and Discretionary dipping 2.8%. Only Technology and Communication Services are holding near their highs.   As we said late last week, market breadth has turned negative quickly after a strong period from mid-April to mid-May. NYSE breadth was a weak -2160, the second-worst reading in 2024, after a -1913 print on May 23. NYSE advancing/total issues was 21% and up volume/total volume was 16%, near the weak levels from May 23.   Treasury yields have done an about-face, with the 10-year up to 4.62% from 4.32%, the fives up to 4.64% from 4.34%, and the twos back near 5%.

Looking at 13F filings of big institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy last quarter taking advantage of that dip. Citadel Advisors went on a buying spree, adding to its $100 billion portfolio across a range of sectors. As did D.E. Shaw, adding to its $67 billion portfolio. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 4Q24. We review 13Fs of major activists to determine core holdings and new purchases.

As quickly as it soared, it then came crashing down, tracing out a very narrow Christmas tree and ultimately bottoming in 1992 at $79. Since early 1986, the greenback has been trapped in a fairly wide range between $71, hit in 2008, and $120, reached in early 2002. Since a secondary low was hit in 2011, the USD has been in a fairly consistent but wide bullish channel.

Alphabet lost a steep 10% in one day last week after investors expressed their disappointment over growth in its cloud business. That same day, Microsoft surged after reporting better-than-expected growth in its Azure OpenAI cloud service. The race is on, and some will win and some will lose along the way. But the potential pie is big. In the internet era, in which digital commerce complements or has supplanted physical commerce, the information technology needs of all enterprises have grown. The traditional on-premises approach has been rendered inefficient, given that a user's IT needs may fluctuate at any time. Into this void, the Cloud has arrived. In Cloud services models, an enterprise's IT needs can be matched and scaled in real time. Through the Cloud, enterprises consume only as much computing, storage, and networking bandwidth as they need. For a major event, this allows massive scaling of IT resources beyond the restraints of on-premises implementation. For periods in which operations are steady, the Cloud services model allows for a needs-only application. The leading providers of Cloud services tend to be large Technology and Communication Services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their Cloud businesses. Growth has been impressive for this group. Collectively, participants in the Cloud eco-system grew revenue at a 19% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2022. Still, the line isn't straight up.  While Cloud services grew at a 23% growth rate from 2020 to 2021, the average growth rate slowed to 15.3% for 2022.  This slowdown in revenue growth reflected impediments to normal business activity from the supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising interest rates. Even so, demand for Cloud services has held up relatively well, given that Cloud transition is a long-tailed process and that Cloud transformation has become an imperative. Here is a list of U.S.-based companies followed by Argus and that we think are in position to take advantage of this secular trend.\"},{\"id\":\"2710_Analyst Report_1698427508000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Amazon.com Inc.\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2023-10-27T17:25:08Z\",\"summary\":\"Amazon.com is the leading U.S. e-commerce retailer and among the top e-commerce sites globally.

Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.\"},{\"id\":\"37620_Technical Analysis_1694430940000\",\"title\":\"Technical Assessment: Neutral in the Intermediate-Term\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2023-09-11T11:15:40Z\",\"summary\":\"This could be an important week for the financial markets, with the major stock indices popping back to the underside (potential resistance) or just above (as with the Nasdaq 100) their 50-day averages -- and all with a lower high in place.

IoT (machine to machine or M2M) connections are expected to grow at a 30% CAGR. Security is a top need, as \\\"denial of service\\\" attacks are set to double by 2023. To handle the challenges of managing, storing, and securing data amid this explosive traffic growth, data centers will need to harness the power of artificial intelligence. AI enhances data center capabilities though the power of machine learning, inference, and deep learning, all in an application-accelerated environment. The AI data center also makes use of non-traditional and emerging technologies that provide more computing power than traditional CPU-based architectures. These include GPU Compute from NVidia and Tensor cores from Google/Alphabet. As of mid-year 2021, about 600 hyperscale data centers were in operation around the world, up from about 500 at year-end 2019 and double the number from five years ago. The bulk of data center construction is by hyperscale providers including AWS from Amazon.com, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud from Alphabet, as well as with Chinese companies including Baidu and Alibaba.

The re-opening trend continues to drive growth, as jobs gains were led by sectors such as leisure and hospitality (380k) and local government education (221k). Industries including professional and business services also added jobs. The prior two months featured strong upward revisions, with May growth at 583,000 jobs and June at 938,000.

Millennials are already coveted by marketers, even though their annual average income is 40% below the spending levels of the generation ahead of them (Gen X) and 30% below the spending levels of Baby Boomers, who are slowing down.
